# Analysis

By searching was certutil does we discovered that it is considered a legal binary offered by Windows OS. The user run certutil to download a version of nmap and later on he started performing a scan of the internal network. The scan was performed on the subnet: 192.168.0.0/24 looking at services running specifically on port 80.

```
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.92-setup.exe nmap.zip

nmap -sV 192.168.0.0/24 -p 80
```

# Conclusion

The alert was a true positive. The purpose of suspicious activities performed with legal binaries for this incident was to download the tool called nmap. No malware was detected on the machine so we can assume it has been the user of the system who run the terminal commands.
