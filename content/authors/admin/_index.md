Greetings! I am a Masterâ€™s Degree student in Computer Science, specializing in Cyber Security at the University of Trento. I am an inquisitive
person, eager to learn new skills and always seeking new topics to explore. I recently completed an internship at SAP Security Research, where I contributed to the devolpment of an automated tool for mining vulnerabilities in open source software repositories. Currently, I am working on my Master's thesis, focusing on the same topic that I explored during my internship. 

While I'm relatively new to the CTF (Capture The Flag) world, I'm enthusiastic about exploring its challenges and learning new technologies. I share my journey through the notes I take and the writeups I create, documenting my experiences and discoveries. This website proudly serves as a showcase of my achievements, including degrees, work experience, certifications, and projects.

On a lighter note, I have a fondness for monkeys and apes. Although I promise not to write code with the same quality as a monkey would, I embrace a playful and creative approach to problem-solving.
